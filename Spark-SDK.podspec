                        Particle (formerly Spark) iOS Cloud SDK Cocoapod library
                        The Particle iOS Cloud SDK enables iOS apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products via the Particle Cloud.
                        Library will allow you to easily manage active user sessions to Particle cloud, query for device info,
                        read and write data to/from Spark Core/Photon devices and (via exposed variables and functions)
                        publish and subscribe events to/from the cloud or to/from devices (coming soon).
                        notice: Spark has been rebranded as Particle
